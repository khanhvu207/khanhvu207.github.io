Me and a friend at ETHZ started to solve some math problems for fun, and we plan to do this weekly.
To keep track of my progress, I will try to post the solutions to the problems (if I manage to solve them) on my website.
Also, please spare me if the solutions are not the most elegant ones, I am still learning :)

This week we started with a problem from the AIME (American Invitational Mathematics Examination) in the year 2000.

## AIME I 2000 Problem 12

[Link to the problem](https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/2000_AIME_I_Problems)

Given a function $$f$$ for which

$$f(x) = f(398 - x) = f(2158 - x) = f(3214 - x)$$

holds for all real $x,$ what is the largest number of different values that can appear in the list $$f(0),f(1),f(2),\ldots,f(999)$$?

## My solution

Since the property holds for all real $x$, we can start to plug in around the given values to see if we can find a pattern:

$$
\begin{align}
f(x) &= f(398 - x) = f(2158 - x) = f(3214 - x)\\
&= f(398 - (2158 - x)) = f(x - 1760) \tag{1}\\
&= f(398 - (3214 - x)) = f(x - 2816) \tag{2}\\
&= f(2158 - (3214 - x)) = f(x - 1056) \tag{3}\\
&= f(2158 - (398 - x)) = f(x + 1760) \tag{4}\\
&= f(3214 - (398 - x)) = f(x + 2816) \tag{5}\\
&= f(3214 - (2158 - x)) = f(x + 1056) \tag{6}
\end{align}
$$

From $$(6)$$, we can see that the function is periodic with a period of 1056.
But we can do better than that! Consider plugging $$(3)$$ into $$(4)$$, we get:

$$
f(x) = f(x - 1056 + 1760) = f(x + 704)
$$

This means that the function is also periodic with a period of 704 and so on if we plug in the other equations.
Starting with a tuple $$(1056, 1760, 2816)$$, we can generate all the periods of the function by subtracting the smaller number from the larger one.
For instance, we have the following chain of periods:

$$
(1056, 1760, 2816) \rightarrow (704, 1056, 1760) \rightarrow (352, 704, 1056) \rightarrow (352, 352, 704) \rightarrow (0, 352, 352) \rightarrow (0, 0, 352)
$$

So it holds that $$f(x) = f(x + 352)$$.
This means that the function is periodic with a period of 352, and we can not get any further with this construction.
The answer must be at most 352 for now.

For $$x\in[0,398]$$, the function $$f(x)$$ is symmetric since $$f(x) = f(398 - x)$$.
Furthermore, the function is also symmetric for $$x\in[0, 46]$$ since:

$$
\begin{align}
f(x) = f(398 - (x + 352)) = f(46 - x)
\end{align}
$$

Hence, it can only be for $$x\in[\frac{46}{2}, \frac{398}{2}]$$ that the function $$f(x)$$ can take on different values.
So the answer is $$199-23+1=\boxed{177}$$.
