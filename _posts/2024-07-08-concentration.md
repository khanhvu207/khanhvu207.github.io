Many important results in statistics and machine learning rely on one fact about the sum of random variables: *if the random variables are independent, then the average of the random variables is concentrated around its mean.*
Concentration bounds give us a precise way to quantify this phenomenon.
In this blog post, I will discuss some of the most common bounds and how they can be used in practice.

## Simple concentration bounds

## Hoeffding's inequality

## Chernoff bounds
