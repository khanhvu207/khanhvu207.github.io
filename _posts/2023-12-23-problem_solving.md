## Meta

When facing with a hard math/programming problem, my procedure usually goes like:

- Understand the problem
- Think about the extreme cases
- Make observations

Indeed, the steps are very problem-specific, but the three above are generally sufficient to make some baby steps toward to big solution.
The procedure that I outline here is only about the investigation of the underlying solution.
After all, you would have to convince others that the soundness of your discoveries rigorous proofs, but I will not talk about that here.
In addition, I think the speed that you go through the ideas in your mind is somewhat important. The faster you try out the ideas, the more ideas you will have.
