*"All problems in mathematics are psychological." - Pierre Deligne, Field medalist 1978.*

For my peace of mind, I needed to understand the concept of conjugacy and its application in the dual problems in convex optimization.
By understanding, I meant to say that at least I want to have a good mental representation of these mathematical objects.
This mental representation must be versatile enough to facilitate a greater understanding of other related things.
