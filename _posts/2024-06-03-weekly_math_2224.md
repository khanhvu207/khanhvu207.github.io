This week we decided to level up the difficulty by attempting two problems from the Putnam competition.

## Problem 1 (2018 Putnam A5)

Let $$f:\mathbb{R}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$$ be an indefinitely differentiable function satisfying $$f(0)=0$$, $$f(1)=1$$, and $$f(x)\geq 0$$ for all $$x\in\mathbb{R}$$.
Show that there exists a positive integer $n$ and a real number $$x$$ such that $$f^{(n)}(x)<0$$.

### My approach

If there exists $$x<y\in\mathbb{R}$$ such that $$f(x)>f(y)$$, then by the mean value theorem, there exists a point $$c\in(x,y)$$ such that $$f'(c)=\frac{f(x)-f(y)}{x-y}<0$$.
So the only interesting case is when $$f$$ is non-decreasing on $$\mathbb{R}$$, i.e. $$f'(x)\geq 0$$ for all $$x\in\mathbb{R}$$.
In this case, $$f(x)=f'(x)=0$$ for all $$x\in(-\infty,0]$$.

From the mean value theorem, there exists some $$c_1\in(0,1)$$ such that 

$$
f'(c_1)=\frac{f(1)-f(0)}{1-0}=1
$$

As before, we can assume that $$f'(x)$$ is non-decreasing on $$\mathbb{R}$$, and that $$\forall x\in(-\infty,0], f'(x)=0$$, $$f'(c_1)=1$$.
Applying the same argument for higher-order derivatives, we can construct a sequence $$1>c_1>c_2>\ldots>c_n>0$$ such that $$f^{(n)}(c_n)=1$$. 

From this, we can make $$c_n$$ abitrarily close to 0 as $$n\rightarrow\infty$$, implying that $$f^{(n)}$$ is discontinuous at $$x=0$$, e.g. $$f^{(n)}$$ becomes a step function at 0.
This contradicts the assumption that $$f$$ is indefinitely differentiable (derivatives of all orders must be continuous), so it is not true that $$f^{(n)}(x)\geq 0$$ for all $$n\in\mathbb{N}$$ and $$x\in\mathbb{R}$$.


## Problem 2 (2008 Putnam A2)

Alan and Barbara play a game in which they take turns filling entries of an initially empty $$2008 \times 2008$$ array.
Alan plays first.
At each turn, a player chooses a real number and places it in a vacant entry.
The game ends when all the entries are filled.
Alan wins if the determinant of the resulting matrix is nonzero;
Barbara wins if its is zero. Which player has a winning strategy?

### My approach

Work in progress...
