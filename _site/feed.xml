For the sake of completeness, here is the problem statement:</p>

<p><em>Suppose you’re on a game show, and you’re given the choice of three doors: Behind one door is a car; behind the others, goats. You pick a door, say No. 1, and the host, who knows what’s behind the doors, opens another door, say No. 3, which has a goat. He then says to you, “Do you want to pick door No. 2?” Is it to your advantage to switch your choice?</em></p>

<p>Let $X_2$ be the event that the car is behind door 2, $Y_1$ be the event that you pick door 1, and $H_3$ be the event that the host opens door 3.
The mental gymnastics is now the compare $P(X_2 \mid Y_1)$ with $P(X_2|Y_1,H_3)$.
Well, we can use Baye’s rule to compute this:</p>

\[\begin{align}
P(X_2\mid Y_1,H_3) = \frac{P(H_3\mid X_2,Y_1)P(X_2\mid Y_1)}{P(H_3\mid Y_1)}
\end{align}\]

<p>Now $P(X_2\mid Y_1) = P(X_2) = \frac{1}{3}$, since the car is equally likely to be behind any of the doors and is independent of your choice.
Second, $P(H_3 \mid X_2, Y_1) = 1$ because if the car is behind door 2 and door 1 is chosen by you, the host must open door 3.
Finally, $P(H_3 \mid Y_1) = \frac{1}{2}$ because the host can open either door 2 or door 3 with equal probability if the knowledge of the car’s location is not taken into account.
So it is clear that</p>

\[P(X_2\mid Y_1,H_3) = \frac{1\cdot 1/3}{1/2} = \frac{2}{3},\]

<p>which implies that switching is the better option.</p>]]></content><author><name>Khánh Vũ</name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[One simple way to think about the Monty Hall problem is to use Baye’s rule.
