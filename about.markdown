I am a Master's student in Computer Science at [ETH Zürich](https://ethz.ch/en.html), enrolled in [Machine Intelligence](https://inf.ethz.ch/studies/master/master-cs-2020.html) major. Before that, I obtained a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at [Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam](https://vu.nl/en). During my undergraduate, I was fortunate to work on two machine learning research under the supervision of [Prof. Dr. Piek Vossen](https://vossen.info/) and [Prof. Vincent François-Lavet](http://vincent.francois-l.be/). My current mentor at ETH Zürich is [Prof. Thomas Hofmann](http://www.da.inf.ethz.ch/people/ThomasHofmann).

I find research papers like [this](https://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume3/bengio03a/bengio03a.pdf), [this](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1312.6199.pdf), and [this one](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.00876.pdf) are elegant in many ways. The impact of these works is needless to say, yet their deliveries are very succinct and easy to read. Academic papers often go in the opposite direction where complexity implies novelty. Therefore, I always aim for the simplest presentation of ideas. This is, by no means, an easy endeavor.
