I am a Master's student in Computer Science at [ETH Zürich](https://ethz.ch/en.html), specializing in theoretical computer science and machine learning.
Before that, I obtained a Bachelor's Honors degree in Computer Science at [Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam](https://vu.nl/en).
During my undergraduate, I was fortunate to work on two machine learning research under the supervision of [Prof. Dr. Piek Vossen](https://vossen.info/) and [Prof. Vincent François-Lavet](http://vincent.francois-l.be/).
At ETH Zürich, I was under the supervision of [Prof. Thomas Hofmann](http://www.da.inf.ethz.ch/people/ThomasHofmann) and [Prof. Andreas Krause](https://las.inf.ethz.ch/krausea).

My research interests include statistical learning theory, statistical inference and learning algorithms in general.
