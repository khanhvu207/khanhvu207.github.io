This blog post is a personal collection of some of the powerful ideas and techniques in theoretical computer science, which I have found to be particularly interesting and useful but are not often covered in standard CS curricula.

The recurring theme that you shall see is $$\color{darkgreen}{\text{approximation algorithms}}$$.
Many combinatorial problems are NP-hard, but if you allow yourself to be content with a not-too-bad solution (i.e., a solution which is in an $$\varepsilon$$-proximity to the optimal solution), then you can often find a $$\text{poly}(\varepsilon^{-1})$$-time algorithm that gives you such a solution.
Besides runtime, the trade-off can also be between the space complexity and the quality of the solution; for instance, we can have a low-memory solution that gives a good approximation to the optimal solution.
